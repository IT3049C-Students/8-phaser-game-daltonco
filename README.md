## Self-Reflection:

This was really ncie to be able to find our own tutorial to work through. The one I found was a little less involved than I wanted, but I found it to be fun. It reinforced thigns we learned in the first Phaser assignment and also showed be some different ways to do things compared to the first one. This one also was more straight to the point and wasn't missing steps like I felt the first assignment did.

### How long it took me to finish this?
1.5 hours
